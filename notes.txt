HI, ill probably move this to the readme file but this page is dedicated to my notes so i can layout ideas 
the whole jist of this project it to make a pid controller but it uses machine learning to tune it's self 
i also wanna make a custom odom so ill be using a hobby motor and an arduino the housing and odom system are still
to be determined. 

CAD to get the motor spinning:

  because im using a small 5v hobby motor im going to tourqe it up with a small gearbox i desgin in inventor ill try 
  to put the file up on github if it lets me. I wont account for an odom system rn because i still need to do research on that 
  but ill have a working system to implent that into.
