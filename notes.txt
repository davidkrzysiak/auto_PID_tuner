HI, ill probably move this to the readme file but this page is dedicated to my notes so i can layout ideas 
the whole jist of this project it to make a pid controller but it uses machine learning to tune it's self 
i also wanna make a custom odom so ill be using a hobby motor and an arduino the housing and odom system are still
to be determined. 

CAD to get the motor spinning:

  because im using a small 5v hobby motor im going to tourqe it up with a small gearbox i desgin in inventor ill try 
  to put the file up on github if it lets me. I wont account for an odom system rn because i still need to do research on that 
  but ill have a working system to implement that into.

odom research: 
  
  im going to stick to a pulse incremental encoder because i could do an absoulte postition encoder but its less useful because 
  its difficult have 50 unique and readable binanry strips on a gear. Also if this thing is turning thousands of degrees knowing 
  the absolute position of the wheel is not particularly usful if i strictly need position and i have a decent sampling rate 
  deciding if i want to go optical or mechanical (magnetic would be too cumbersome) is a little trickier 
  the benefits to ***OPTICAL*** PROS. is that i could steal the optical encoder from a vex motor also the limiting factor of how fast i 
  can go is olny limited by the computers sampling rate. Also there it no wear and tear problem. the CONS are that the three wires on
  what i assume is the infrared sensor are scary and i dont understand it fully. Also if i have an open air motor there may be some 
  problems of the sensor catching bad signals from the enviroment. I could close this thing but thats extra work and itll be a pain 
  to test it. ***MECHANICAL*** PROS its basically just making a switch that gets turned on and off by spinning therefore it will
  be a lot quicker to figure out how to implement. CONS. it will produce friction because of the brushes and it also may be 
  difficult to position said brushes. 

  i have pretty thin wire on hand so im going to make a mechanical odom. the plan is too basiclly make a grill looking 
  structure with a single length of wire. this would be connected to the sensor pin on an arduino. then a brush
  will be connected to the power pin and drag across this latter. every rung will be a new increment. initially i want at least 
  50 ticks so each increment is equivenent to about 7.2 degree. A design on the gear to accommidate for this latter will be on the 
  github labeled as V2_for_odom_spur gear32

  the next step is to make a brush for the gear ladder to offer the least amount of resistance im goin gto use braided wire 
  to position the wire it would be ideal to install it perpendicular to the ladder in order for the wire to restore itself 
  in the area between the wires instead of the next rung of wires ill add the updated ipt files of the new housing onto 
  github when i finish the model.
